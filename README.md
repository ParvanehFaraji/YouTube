In this project, I predict the number of negative votes (dislike_count column) for videos using the provided dataset and applying linear or non-linear regression models. 
## Project Steps:
1. **Loading Training Data and Data Preprocessing in Python**  
   - Import the dataset and perform necessary cleaning and transformation steps to prepare the data for analysis.  

2. **Fitting Multiple Regression Models and Comparing Them**  
   - Train several regression models (both linear and non-linear) and evaluate their performance.  

3. **Visualizing the Prediction Accuracy of Regression Models**  
   - Create visualizations to illustrate and compare the predictive accuracy of the designed regression models.  

4. **Comparing Regression Models Based on Various Numerical Metrics**  
   - Use multiple quantitative metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to compare the performance of different models.  

5. **Selecting the Best Model and Predicting Negative Votes on Test Data**  
   - Identify the best-performing model and use it to predict the number of negative votes (dislike_count) in the test dataset.
